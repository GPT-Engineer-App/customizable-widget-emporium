# customizable-widget-emporium

An e-commerce site where each element is individualized as widgets, including the title section. Implement a feature where a 'Add Widget' button automatically scrolls in from the left side of the screen. Upon clicking this button, users should be able to add new widgets to the site. This design should offer flexibility and customization, allowing users to tailor the layout and functionality of their e-commerce platform. The interface should be intuitive, with a focus on enhancing the user experience for both desktop and mobile users.
